# Safai Saathi - Trash Type Recognition

Welcome to **Safai Saathi** ‚Äì your companion for cleaner, greener waste management! This project uses the power of AI to simplify waste segregation and help users make environmentally responsible choices. Safai Saathi is designed to recognize types of trash, guide proper disposal, and provide insights on waste management best practices. 

## üåç Project Overview

**Safai Saathi** leverages image recognition and advanced machine learning to automatically detect and categorize trash. The goal is simple yet impactful: to make waste segregation more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly. By using this bot, people can get real-time information on how to sort and dispose of waste effectively, ultimately helping reduce the burden on landfills and our planet.

### Key Features

- **Automated Trash Detection**: Instantly recognize different types of trash through images and guide users on proper disposal.
- **Waste Segregation Best Practices**: Learn the most effective ways to sort and manage waste at home or in public spaces.
- **Insights on Environmental Impact**: Understand how your actions contribute to sustainability goals and cleaner communities.

## üèÜ Project Goals

- **Promote Efficient Waste Segregation**: By helping users sort waste correctly, Safai Saathi aims to improve recycling rates and reduce contamination.
- **Raise Awareness**: Educate users on the importance of waste segregation and its impact on the environment.
- **Support Sustainable Development**: This project aligns with various UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including responsible consumption and climate action.
- **Data Collection for Good**: Collects data on trash depositted that can be used to keep count and to implement future practices.

## üìã How It Works

The system uses a blend of computer vision and machine learning to analyze images of waste items. Here‚Äôs the basic flow:

1. **Image Capture**: Users snap a picture of the waste item with their smartphone or any camera-enabled device.
2. **Trash Detection**: The AI model identifies the item type (plastic, paper, metal, organic waste, hazardous materials, etc.).
3. **Guided Disposal**: The bot suggests the proper bin or disposal method for the item.
4. **Data Collection & Insights**: Waste patterns are recorded to help improve local waste management strategies.
